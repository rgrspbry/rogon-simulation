rogon-simulation
================

A simulation of the universe as a perpetual motion machine with rogons as its cogs.
Please see http://www.rogontheory.org for more details.
I am hoping that this simulation will be programmed in Haskell and able to run on any operating system especially
Debian Linux.
To create a random number generator with equal chance of any number produced being anywhere equally distributed between
+ and - infinity using straight line emanating from the focus of a parabola to the intersection of the parabola at it's
x-coordinate representing the number by first generating a number between 0 and 360 representing the angle of the line 
to hit the intersection at from the focus.
